## (Temporary) File Name Guide

I'm currently in the process of renaming the model menu items to make their names more human-readable. The following is a guide on how to parse them to find the model and animation you might be looking for:

### Animation Names

-  101\_\*: Animations for when the model in is history lessons
-  102\_\*: Animations for when the model is in flight lessons
-  103\_\*: Animations for when the model is in alchemy lessons
-  800\_\*: Animations for when the model is cooking during Culinary Crucible events
-  900\_\*: Animations for when the model is in battle
-  000\_\*: Not sure, I think they're for when the model is in your guest room? If anyone knows for sure, please let me know
-  failure: Animation that plays when you miss a note in a Twistune
-  success: Animation that plays when you hit a note in a Twistune
-  wait: Animation that plays when there are no notes being hit in a Twistune
-  Most of the other animation names are self-explanatory, for example ones with "attack" in the name are used for when the model attacks in a battle, ones named "idle" are used when the model is idling, etc.
-  Another note: On the event models, any extra animations that are specific to the event are at the very bottom of the list of animations, and usually do not have a "XXX\_" prefix. For example, the Harveston Sledathon models have animations named "dash" where they're riding their sleds.
